# 2025-.Py-project
making an application based off 
THIS: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/video-games-sales




coded in .py

feature 1: 
- make user type in said game, this results in charts that display the sales in different regions and other stats that are related to the game

- we could make it into a bar chart. Each bar representing sales in an according area, for games released on multiple consoles we will have to either make multiple seperate bar charts or overlapping bar charts

- user friendly appearance, style accordingly

feature 2: 

syntax: "which [game] was most popular in [game_year_stats (etc,etc)]" 

5 answers per game (in a high to low order, sorted out of the dataset.) 
should make some cool graphing object that can graph the popularity of the game over given time period

different q types 
 - sort game sales by region in order
 - which game was least to most selling generally in order
 - questions with multiple answers 
 - variable amount of potential answers (2-5)
 - true or false

I meant that we discard the game idea and just do the graph thing - tony
